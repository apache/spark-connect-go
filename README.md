# Apache Spark Connect Client for Golang

This project houses the **experimental** client for [Spark
Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html) for
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) written in [Golang](https://go.dev/).


## Current State of the Project

Currently, the Spark Connect client for Golang is highly experimental and should
not be used in any production setting. In addition, the PMC of the Apache Spark
project reserves the right to withdraw and abandon the development of this project
if it is not sustainable.
