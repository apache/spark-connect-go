# Apache Spark Connect Client for Golang

This project houses the **experimental** client for [Spark
Connect](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-connect-overview.html) for
[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) written in [Golang](https://go.dev/).

## Current State of the Project

Currently, the Spark Connect client for Golang is highly experimental and should
not be used in any production setting. In addition, the PMC of the Apache Spark
project reserves the right to withdraw and abandon the development of this project
if it is not sustainable.

## Getting started

This section explains how to run Spark Connect Go locally.

Step 1: Install Golang: https://go.dev/doc/install.

Step 2: Ensure you have installed `buf CLI` installed, [more info here](https://buf.build/docs/installation/)

Step 3: Run the following commands to setup the Spark Connect client.

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/spark-connect-go.git
git submodule update --init --recursive

make gen && make test
```

Step 4: Setup the Spark Driver on localhost.

1. [Download Spark distribution](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) (3.4.0+), unzip the package.

2. Start the Spark Connect server with the following command (make sure to use a package version that matches your Spark distribution):

```
sbin/start-connect-server.sh --packages org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.4.0
```

Step 5: Run the example Go application.

```
go run cmd/spark-connect-example-spark-session/main.go
```

## High Level Design

The overall goal of the design is to find a good balance of principle of the least surprise for
develoeprs that are familiar with the APIs of Apache Spark and idiomatic Go usage. The high-level
structure of the packages follows roughly the PySpark giudance but with Go idioms.
